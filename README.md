# Do phonons act as an effective descriptor for fast-ion transport?

# Introduction
This repository contains a collection of notebooks and data that investigate the link
between vibrational properties and diffusive properties in solids. 

# Preliminary: PhononDB
Phonon data is obtained from the phonon calculation database created by Atsushi Togo. Please refer
to (https://github.com/WMD-group/phononDB) to query the phonon data.

# 1. Get data: phonon density of states and phonon descriptors
The notebook `01_get_data.ipynb` contains functions required to organise the phonon density of
states
